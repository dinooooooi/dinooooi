                              Losing the side cursor gives Kindle 2 a cleaner look ,  but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit .\\n12

that while Amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, Amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .\\n14

fast ,  and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .\\n15

navigating .\\n34

places you want to navigate than use the joystick .\\n35

Instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .\\n36

table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .\\n41

because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the Kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .\\n42

                                                          The Kindle is really fun to use and I'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .\\n43

also found using the navigation button difficult .\\n45

ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

                                                           Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter

                                                                                       I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

.\\n47

                                             And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                      I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54

for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

conditions .\\n57

One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

               I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94

in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

           you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                                              Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

you to fit more on the screen .\\n170                                                                                                                                                                                                           I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                                                       And maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

                                                          Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39

                                                                                                                                           The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

             One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48

                                                                                       Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

quick .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                        I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58

    Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61

                              Losing the side cursor gives Kindle 2 a cleaner look ,  but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit .\\n12

that while Amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, Amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .\\n14

fast ,  and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .\\n15

navigating .\\n34

places you want to navigate than use the joystick .\\n35

Instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .\\n36

table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .\\n41

because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the Kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .\\n42

                                                          The Kindle is really fun to use and I'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .\\n43

also found using the navigation button difficult .\\n45

ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

                                                           Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter

                                                                                       I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

.\\n47

                                             And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                      I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54

for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

conditions .\\n57

One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

               I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94

in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

           you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                                              Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

you to fit more on the screen .\\n170                                                                                                                                                                                                           I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                                                       And maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

                                                          Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37

were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39

                                                                                                                                           The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

             One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48

                                                                                       Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

quick .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                        I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58

    Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61

room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n176

heat on until the next day .\\n56

                             The wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager was a really nice touch as was the free tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning which got you off to a great start for the day .\\n58

        Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\u0092t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n61

when we had an early start .\\n62

      Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65

thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                 We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67

worth seeing and what is not .\\n68

that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71

which was good quality but why ?\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .\\n73

but the fee is not out of line .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                   There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75

free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel,

                                                        We have stayed at The Tuscan Inn on our last 3 trips to San Francisco, and I really can't fault the service .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                         The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .\\n28                                                                                                         All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Never experienced the room service .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Excellent service great location good value\\n35                                                                                                      The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The food and service were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45

                                                                                                        We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                                                                                                                                                                                          The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                          The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                             I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                      Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The service in the hotel was really good .\\n59                                                                                                                                                     The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61                                                                                                                           However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                   We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .\\n63                                                                                                                      We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements

can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving

                                       Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

                                   Does the new operating system have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55

that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

              If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

                                                 Screen does not scratch, but can get fingerprints easily .\\n41

battery lasts much longer than stated  .\\n42                                                                                                                                           but I'm really disappointed they didn't keep the same finish as last year's matte finish, last year's model never got fingerprints, except on the screen itself, and looked new at all times .\\n43

replacement for an older classic, which was a great unit but time has taken it's toll on the battery and screen .\\n56

                                                       When I found out about the Dell Mini 10v coming out, I ordered one with upgrades to a six cell battery and larger hard drive .\\n39

     The 1008HA was not a consideration because of the non, removable battery and significantly shorter battery life .\\n42

plugged it into the outlet in the living room and allowed the battery to charge .\\n54                                                                                                                                                              Recently, however, my battery was about to die, and I had already set up shop in another room of my house, so I decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while I worked on it .\\n55

    The battery life is quite extensive .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                        If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n57

feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .\\n76

with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77                                                                                                                                                               If your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

                        The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle

but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

Styling is bland, the engine isn't strong at all, and the car doesn't deliver good comfort while driving it .\\n9

                        It's a pretty good car, reliable, comfortable as far as it goes, but limited rear visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving

good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly recommend

                                       You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35

would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                    Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46

                                                  The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74

                                                                        Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78

longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works

have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage

expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

                    I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

                   The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39

While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64

                                                     It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69

mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well

                                                                                                                                            I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                  It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83

                                                                                                                                                                                 I hope to get better

speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

                                                                                                                                                                                                I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n18

including fast food if you like .\\n19                                                                                                                                              Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

.\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                              There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n38

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat .\\n2

were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters .\\n3

onsite so I can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .\\n5

snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .\\n6

allotted approximately $150 for \\u0093food\\u0094 for 4 days 3 nights .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                  But the presentation was awesome and the food was so good and not having to walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .\\n8

       The food was delicious and the view was fabulous .\\n9                                                                                                                                                      For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 .\\n10

bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .\\n11

was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .\\n12

the hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

food tends to be mediocre .\\n14

throughout the day .\\n16

for delivery .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                                                         there is a market one block south of the Hyatt that has wine beer and food for reasonable prices until 2am, and a Dominick's   grocery store across the river open til 1am .\\n18

have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

                                                      After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

        Should have been priced at $250  .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                                        The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I'm positive that future releases will bring the price point down .\\n59

list of 20 books .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                       Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

free your shelves for figurines or a nice bottle collection !\\n62

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It was obviously out of my price range .\\n64

I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n71

                                                     Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the

expected .\\n36                                                                                                                                                     It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                         Initial gas mileage looks good too .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                 It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great !\\n49                                                                                                                                           Fun to drive, fairly roomy, looks good, gas mileage is OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52

                                                                                                               I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55                                                                                                                                                     It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas

speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .\\n5

                                                                                             The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .\\n9                                                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n10

to go on your route .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                  My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .\\n12

your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n14                                                                                                     In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .\\n15                                                                                                                The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                  For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .\\n17                                                                                                                    So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18

display it !\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The display is great, and is very clear .\\n21                                                                                                                                                      The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n23                                                                                                                                Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .\\n24

spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n26

areas I am familiar with :\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                               But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate

sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30

day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .\\n34

control of that as well .\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\\n37

.\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Garmin has a nice 3d display .\\n39

and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold
